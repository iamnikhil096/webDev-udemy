	<!-- Form validation means the ability to impose rules/restrictions in structure of different parts of a form. -->
		<!-- example - the password field should not be emty, email field should have valid email address, username should not exceed 15 characters, etc. -->

	<!-- usinig HTML features we can't impose all the types of restrictions(for that we have to use JS and other Backend technologies.) that we want to, but 	  we definitely can use some validations provided in HTML5 -->
	<form>
		<!-- we will use "required" keyword with input fields to impose restriction on that input field - this restriction doesn't let the form to submit 				until and unless we provide some input for that input field type. i.e. we cannot leave that field blank. -->
		<!--  required - it is an Presence validation, it means to make sure that something is present. -->
		<label for="Username">UserName :</label>
		<input type="text" name="Username" id="Username" placeholder="Username" required>
		<label for="Password">Password :</label>
		<input type="password" name="Password" id="Password" placeholder="Password" required>

		<!-- Another type of validation example is, using "email" as type of input field, we can restrict the browser to accept only valid emails in that 			
			field and not any other text. -->
		<label for="email">Email : </label>
		<input type="email" name="Email" id="email" required>
		<button>ok</button>
